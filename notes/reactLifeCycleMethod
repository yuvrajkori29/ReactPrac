    Mounting (birth) ------> Updating(Changes) ------> Unmounting(Death)

    1.Mounting Phase : 
      In mounting phase react component is mounted on real dom. We have several methods which will run in mounting phase automatically.
     i) Constructor() :  it is used to initialize.
      it loads only once in entire lifecycle.
      inside constructor we should not write business logic.
      should not use side-effect (no api calls like setTimeout,FetchApi etc).
      it is mandatory to use super() to call parent class.

      ii) getDerivedStateFromProps():
      It is called after constructor in this method we can update state or we can initialised the state with intial props.
      It take state as an arg and return object with change in state.

      iii) render :
       it is used to write UI logic
       should not use sideeffect.
       should not write business logic.


      componentDidMount :- 
      it is called after render method 
      we can write business logic
      we can use sideeffects (api calls).
      this method is run only when component is  mounted on real dom.
      we can use setState() method  in componentDIDmount.


      2. Updating phase : 
      it is in which react component is updated is known as updating phase.

      i) getDerivedState from Props()
      ii) shouldComponentUpdate(previous Prop,previous State)
       this method is responsible for component update.
       BY default it return false 
       it means component will not get updated.
       to  update the component this method should return "true" then only render method get snapshot before update() and componentDidMount() implements.

       iii) getSnapShotBeforeUpdate(previous Props,previous State,snapshot)
         it has access of props  and state before update.
         when using  getSnapshot before update() method we have to always use componentDidUpdate() method.



      componentDidUpdate(previous Prop,previous State)   
        this method is called after component is update in realdom.
        we can use  side effect business logic.
        we can use  this  method individually.


        3. Unmouting phase:
          This phase is which component is removed from real dom is known as unmounting phase.

          i) componentWillMount()
            THis method get executed only when component is removed from real dom.
