What is react-router ?
React router is a library  that provides navigational component for react developers to create a single-page applications  with dynamic, client side routing.

React routerProvider component :
 react router can be provided to the entire application using the  <RouterProvider> component from react-router-dom and including a router attribute. In the given example React Router is a provided to the entire application using a 
<RouterProvider> component in the main App component.

import {ReactProvider} from 'react-router-dom' ;


<ReactProvider router={router}   />

Link :
React-router's link component can be used to create links for navigation. The 'to' prop specifies the location to which the user will be redirected after clicking on the <Link>

Rendering a <Link> will insert an anchor tag(<a>) in your html doc , but the  anchors tags default  behavior (trigger a page reload)
will be  disabled. This allows the application's  <Router> to respond to URL changes by rendering the appropriate content.

<Link to='/about'>About</Link>

Outlet : 
The React-router <Outlet> component is  used within the parent route  element to indicate where a child route element should be rendered.
