useRef :

The useRef is a hook that allows to directly create a reference to the DOM element in the functional component.
The main use of useRef hook is to access the DOM elements in a more efficient way as compared to simple refs. 
To import the useRef hook, write the following code at the top level of your component

import { useRef } from 'react';

const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);
The useRef returns a mutable ref object. This object has a property called .current. The value is persisted in the refContainer.current property. These values are accessed from the current property of the returned object. 

it is used to get the address of elements 
ref store element in current property 
to use this ref we have useRef hook.
We have to provide variable name inside ref attribute.
